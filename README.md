Paperpedia

# Paperpedia

Paperpedia is a web-based academic portal developed using Django. It is designed to help students and faculty members easily access previous year question papers. The platform organizes question papers by year, branch, and subject, allowing users to quickly browse and download the materials they need. This improves exam preparation and simplifies the process of finding relevant academic resources.

The system includes an admin panel where administrators can upload new papers, ensuring that the repository remains up to date. The user interface is simple and clean, providing a smooth browsing experience for users.

Paperpedia uses Django for the backend, along with HTML and CSS for the frontend. Uploaded files are stored locally using Djangoâ€™s media file handling system. SQLite is used as the default database, but the project can be easily configured to use other databases as needed.

To set up the project, clone the repository and navigate into the project folder. Create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the required packages using pip. After applying migrations, you can run the Django development server and access the site in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

This project was developed by Rayi Leela Gowri as part of an effort to streamline access to academic resources and support students in their academic journey.
